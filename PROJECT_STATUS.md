URLs:

```text
http://localhost:3000/challenges
http://localhost:3000/challenges/[id]
```

Backend APIs:

```text
GET /api/v1/challenges
GET /api/v1/challenges/{challenge_id}
```

Challenge detail pages currently show:

- Challenge title
- Description
- Difficulty
- Category
- Points
- Starter prompt/context
- Expected output
- Hints
- Prompt attempt UI

### Roadmaps

Users can view structured learning paths.

URL:

```text

## Working Backend Features

The backend is a FastAPI app.

Main backend file:

```text
backend/app/main.py
```

API router:

```text
backend/app/api/v1/router.py
```

Backend endpoint groups:

- Articles
- Challenges
- Roadmaps

```

## Working Database Tables

The database schema is defined in:

```text
database/migrations/
```

Main tables:

- `profiles`
- `articles`
- `challenges`
- `roadmaps`
- `user_progress`
- `challenge_progress`
- `marketplace_prompts`
- `marketplace_favorites`

Seed data exists in:

```text
database/migrations/003_seed_data.sql
database/seed/seed_data.sql
```

## Current Admin Workflow

There is no website admin panel yet.

Today, admin management is done through Supabase directly.

Admins can use Supabase Table Editor or SQL Editor to manage:

- Articles
- Challenges
- Roadmaps
- Users/profiles
- Progress records
- Challenge progress

### Add Article

Admins can insert into the `articles` table.

Required/common fields:

- `title`
- `slug`
- `content`
- `excerpt`
- `category`
- `difficulty`
- `tags`
- `published`

Example:

```sql
insert into public.articles
(title, slug, content, excerpt, category, difficulty, tags, published)
values
(
  'My New Prompt Article',
  'my-new-prompt-article',
  '# My New Prompt Article

Article content here...',
  'Short summary of the article.',
  'fundamentals',
  'beginner',
  array['prompting', 'ai'],
  true
);
```

After adding an article, it appears on:

```text
http://localhost:3000/articles
```

### Add Challenge

Admins can insert into the `challenges` table.

Required/common fields:

- `title`
- `description`
- `difficulty`
- `category`
- `starter_prompt`
- `expected_output`
- `hints`
- `points`

Example:

```sql
insert into public.challenges
(title, description, difficulty, category, starter_prompt, expected_output, hints, points)
values
(
  'Rewrite for Tone',
  'Create a prompt that rewrites a formal email into a friendly Slack message.',
  'easy',
  'transformation',
  'Rewrite this formal email as a friendly Slack message...',
  'A concise Slack-style message preserving all key information.',
  array['Mention tone clearly', 'Preserve dates and names', 'Set a length limit'],
  10
);
```

After adding a challenge, it appears on:

```text
http://localhost:3000/challenges
```

### Add Roadmap

Admins can insert into the `roadmaps` table.

Required/common fields:

- `title`
- `level`
- `description`
- `topics`
- `estimated_hours`

Example:

```sql
insert into public.roadmaps
(title, level, description, topics, estimated_hours)
values
(
  'Prompt Engineering Mastery',
  'advanced',
  'A deep learning path for advanced prompting and AI workflows.',
  '[
    {"order": 1, "title": "Prompt Security", "description": "Understand prompt injection"},
    {"order": 2, "title": "Evaluation", "description": "Learn prompt scoring and testing"}
  ]'::jsonb,
  15
);
```

## Environment Variables

Backend environment file:

```text
backend/.env
```

Important backend variables:

```text
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=
JWT_SECRET=
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
OPENAI_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

Frontend environment file:

```text
frontend/.env.local
```

Important frontend variables:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

## How To Run Locally

### Start Backend

```cmd
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend should run at:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

### Start Frontend

```cmd
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend should run at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## What Is Dynamic Today

The following content is dynamic through backend APIs and Supabase:

- Articles
- Article detail pages
- Challenges
- Challenge detail pages
- Roadmaps
- System design article list
- User progress
- User stats

If the backend or Supabase is unavailable, several frontend pages have fallback demo data so the UI still loads.

## What Is Not Finished Yet

### Admin Panel

There is no frontend admin dashboard yet.

Remaining admin features:

- `/admin` dashboard
- Admin login/role check
- Create article UI
- Edit article UI
- Delete/unpublish article UI
- Create challenge UI
- Edit challenge UI
- Delete challenge UI
- Create roadmap UI
- Edit roadmap UI
- User management UI
- View user progress
- View challenge submissions

### Auto-Evaluation

Auto-evaluation is not fully implemented yet.

Current challenge attempt UI does not truly grade prompts with an LLM.

Planned Phase 4 flow:

1. User submits prompt attempt.
2. Backend receives submission.
3. Backend sends challenge details and user prompt to an LLM.
4. LLM returns:
   - Score
   - Feedback
   - Strengths
   - Improvements
   - Suggested better prompt
5. Backend stores the result in `challenge_progress`.
6. Frontend shows the evaluation result to the user.

Suggested future API:

```text
POST /api/v1/challenges/{challenge_id}/evaluate
```

Suggested response shape:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "score": 82,
  "feedback": "Your prompt is clear but needs a stricter output format.",
  "strengths": ["Clear task", "Good constraints"],
  "improvements": ["Add examples", "Specify JSON schema"],
  "suggested_prompt": "Rewrite..."
}
```

### Human Review Workflow

Human review is not implemented yet.

Remaining features:

- Store submitted prompts
- Admin/reviewer queue
- Reviewer comments
- Manual score
- Approval/rejection status
- Review history

### Playground With Real LLMs

The playground exists, but production LLM behavior depends on API keys and backend implementation.

Remaining features:

- Real OpenAI/Gemini model calls
- Model selector connected to backend
- Token/cost estimates
- ~~Prompt history~~ ✅ Done (localStorage-based)
- Save prompt experiments
- Error handling for provider failures

### Search Upgrade

Current search is basic.

Future improvements:

- Full-text search
- Filters
- Search ranking
- Meilisearch integration
- Highlight matched text

### Production Readiness

Remaining deployment tasks:

- Configure production Supabase project
- Configure deployed backend URL
- Configure deployed frontend URL
- Set CORS origins
- Set secure JWT secret
- Add logging
- Add monitoring
- Add tests
- Add CI/CD
- Add role-based access control

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Build `/admin` routes.
2. Add admin role support.
3. Build article create/edit forms.
4. Build challenge create/edit forms.
5. Build roadmap editor.
6. Add challenge submission storage.
7. Add LLM-based auto-evaluation.
8. Add human review queue.
9. Add production deployment configuration.

## Summary

Prompt Diary is currently a functional full-stack learning platform foundation.

Users can browse learning content, challenges, roadmaps, system design material, and use the dashboard/progress flow when auth is configured.

Admins can manage content today through Supabase, but a proper website-based admin panel is still pending.

The most important remaining work is:

- Admin dashboard
- Dynamic content creation UI
- Auto-evaluation
- Human review workflow
- Real LLM integration (Groq API recommended for free tier)
- Marketplace backend API endpoints
- Production deployment hardening
